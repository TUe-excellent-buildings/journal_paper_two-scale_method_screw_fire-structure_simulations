This repository provides all code and scripts needed to reproduce the finite element simulations presented in:

Xu Q; Hofmeyer H; Maljaars J: A two-scale method to include essential screw connection behaviour in two-way coupled fire-structure simulations, Journal of Structural Fire Engineering.

The code and scripts have been provided by Qingfeng Xu, fall under his responsibility, and have not been checked on the code level by coauthors and/or supervisors.
